This example demonstrates how to use GenAI Security - Semantic Guardrail API to assess security risk in conversations,
with Python's `requests` library.

It submits a multi-turn conversation with a malicious request and a reply with sensitive information, to a local Semantic Guardail service for scanning.

Note: If the `requests` library is not installed, you can add it using:
    pip install requests

# Sample conversation with a malicious user request and an over-helpful AI response.
# Submit a request to Semantic Guardrail to scan a conversation with 2 messages,
# assuming Data Discovery PII detection is running.
# The messsage from the user is to be processed with semantic guardrail and the message from AI is
# to be processed with Data Discovery as PII detector.
