### Preparing the system

Complete the steps provided here to use the samples provided with AI Developer Edition.

>   For MacOS, ensure that the [Additional prerequisites for MacOS](#additional-prerequisites-for-macos) steps are complete.

1.  Open a command prompt.
2.  Clone the git repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Protegrity-AI-Developer-Edition/protegrity-ai-developer-edition.git
    ```
3.  Navigate to the `protegrity-ai-developer-edition` directory in the cloned location.

4.  Start the required services and obtain the necessary credentials.

    **AI Pack components where no API registration is required:**

    Start only the services you need. Each feature directory contains its own `docker-compose.yml`. Selectively spin up components without running the full stack. The dependent containers are large; downloads may take time. These components run locally using Docker containers. No API key or account registration is needed.

    - To start the Data Discovery services:
    ```
    cd data-discovery && docker compose up -d && cd ..
    ```
    - To start the Semantic Guardrail services (includes classification/data-discovery dependencies):
    ```
    cd semantic-guardrail && docker compose up -d && cd ..
    ```
    - To start the Synthetic Data services:
    ```
    cd synthetic-data && docker compose up -d && cd ..
    ```
    - To start the Anonymization services:
    ```
    cd anonymization && docker compose up -d && cd ..
    ```
    - Install Jupyter Lab to run the notebook samples provided.
    > **Note**: It is recommended to install and activate the Python virtual environment.
    ```
    pip install -r shared/requirements.txt
    ```

    **Data Protection components where API registration is required:**

    These components use the Protegrity-hosted API Service for tokenization, encryption, and protect/unprotect operations. You must register and obtain API credentials before running Data Protection samples.

    1. Install the `protegrity-ai-developer-python` module.
        > **Note**: It is recommended to install and activate the Python virtual environment before installing the module.
        ```
        pip install protegrity-ai-developer-python
        ```
        The installation completes and the success message is displayed. Alternatively, to build the module from source, refer to [Building the Python module from source](https://github.com/Protegrity-AI-Developer-Edition/protegrity-ai-developer-python?tab=readme-ov-file#build-the-protegrity-ai-developer-python-module).
    2. For Java samples, the `protegrity-ai-developer-java` module is automatically downloaded from Maven Central when you run a sample for the first time.
        Alternatively, to build the java library from source, refer to [Building the Java module from source](https://github.com/Protegrity-AI-Developer-Edition/protegrity-ai-developer-java?tab=readme-ov-file#build-the-protegrity-ai-developer-java-modules).

### Running the Sample Applications

The samples are organized into two categories:
- **AI Pack Samples with No API Registration Required**: Discover PII, Find and Redact, Data Discovery on Tabular Data, Semantic Guardrail, Anonymization, and Synthetic Data. These run locally against the AI Pack Docker containers.
    - [Data Discovery samples](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/prod_features/data_discovery/dd_using/)
    - [Semantic Guardrails samples](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/prod_features/sem_guard/sgr_using/)
    - [Synthetic Data samples](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/prod_features/synth_data/sd_using/)
    - [Anonymization samples](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/prod_features/anon/anon_using/)
- **Data Protection Samples with API Registration Required**: Find and Protect, Direct Protect or Unprotect from the CLI. These use the Protegrity-hosted API Service for tokenization, encryption, and protect/unprotect operations. Registration is also required for the online Jupyter notebook.
    - [Data Protection samples](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/prod_features/data_prot/prot_using/)

## AI Developer Edition in Agentic AI Workflows

AI agents go beyond simple chat. They plan tasks, call tools, take actions, and coordinate with other agents. As these agents move data across systems autonomously, the risk of exposing sensitive data increases. Protegrity AI Developer Edition helps you protect data at every step of an agentic AI workflow, ensuring sensitive information stays secure even as agents operate with broad privileges.

For more information about using Protegrity AI Developer Edition in agentic AI workflows, refer to the [Protegrity AI Developer Edition documentation](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/).

## 🚚 Moving from Developer Edition to Team Edition

Once your application works against AI Developer Edition, you can move the same code to **Protegrity AI Team Edition** - a hosted, multi-user environment backed by your own Policy Provisioning Cluster (PPC) and Cloud Protect. The exact same Python and Java sample code keeps working: only the endpoint, the authentication mode, and where the policy lives change.

For more information about moving from Protegrity AI Developer Edition to Protegrity AI Team Edition, refer to the [Promoting to AI Team Edition](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/migration/).
