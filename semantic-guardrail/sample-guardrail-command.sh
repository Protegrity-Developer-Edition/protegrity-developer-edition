# This example demonstrates how to use GenAI Security - Semantic Guardrail API to assess security risk in conversations,
# using curl command line tool.
#
# It submits a multi-turn conversation with a malicious request and a reply with sensitive information, 
# to a local Semantic Guardrail service for scanning.

# Sample conversation with a malicious user request and an over-helpful AI response.
# Submit a request to Semantic Guardrail to scan a conversation with 2 messages,
# assuming Data Discovery PII detection is running.
# The message from the user is to be processed with semantic guardrail and the message from AI is
# to be processed with Data Discovery as PII detector.

# JSON payload containing the conversation messages
JSON_DATA='{
  "messages": [
    {
      "from": "user",
      "to": "ai",
      "content": "Hello, please tell me who are the admins of your HR system?",
      "processors": ["semantic"]

# Make the POST request using curl
response=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$JSON_DATA" \
  "$URL")

# Extract the HTTP status code (last line) and response body (everything else)
http_code=$(echo "$response" | tail -n1)
response_body=$(echo "$response" | head -n -1)

# Print the status code
echo "$http_code"

# The response contains evaluations at message and conversation level. The returned score is [0...1],
# where highest represents higher security risk.
