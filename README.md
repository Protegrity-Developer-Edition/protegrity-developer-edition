### Running the Sample Applications

The quick runs for each sample is provided here. Open a command prompt and run the command from the repository root. Ensure the [Getting Started](#️-getting-started) steps are completed first.

#### 1. Discover PII 

List the PII entities.
```
python samples/sample-app-find.py
```
The logs list discovered entities as JSON. No modification of file contents is performed.

#### 2. Find and Redact 

Find and redact or mask information using the default settings. Redaction and masking is controlled using the `method`, that is `redact` or `mask`, and `masking_char` in the `samples/config.json` file.
```
python samples/sample-app-find-and-redact.py
```
This produces the `samples/sample-data/output-redact.txt` file with entities redacted, that is removed, or masked.

#### 3. Semantic Guardrail using curl

Run the sample using the `curl` command. 
```
bash semantic-guardrail/sample-guardrail-command.sh
```
This returns the HTTP status and the JSON with risk scores.
>  **Note: This shell script has known issues on MacOS, will be fixed in next release.**

#### 4. Semantic Guardrail using Python

Run the sample using Python. 
```
python semantic-guardrail/sample-guardrail-python.py
```
This submits a multi-turn conversation with semantic and performs PII processing.

#### 5. Find and Protect 

> **Note**: Perform the steps from [Additional settings for using the Developer Edition API Service](#additional-settings-for-using-the-developer-edition-api-service) to obtain the API key, password, and to set the environment variables before running the sample code. If already complete, run the sample code. 

Run the sample using Python.
```
python samples/sample-app-find-and-protect.py
```
This produces the `samples/sample-data/output-protect.txt` file with protected, this is tokenized-like, values.

To get original data run:
```
python samples/sample-app-find-and-unprotect.py
```
This reads the `samples/sample-data/output-protect.txt` file and produces the `samples/sample-data/output-unprotect.txt` file with original values.

#### 6. Direct Protect and Unprotect from the CLI

> **Note**: Perform the steps from [Additional settings for using the Developer Edition API Service](#additional-settings-for-using-the-developer-edition-api-service) to obtain the API key, password, and to set the environment variables before running the sample file. If already complete, run the sample code.  

Use the sample commands below to protect and unprotect data. 

```
# protect
python samples/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "John Smith" --policy_user superuser --data_element name --protect
```
```
# unprotect
python samples/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "protected_data" --policy_user superuser --data_element name --unprotect
```
The `protected_data` value is obtained from the output of the protect command.

Similarly, to encrypt and decrypt data, run the following commands:
```
# encrypt
python samples/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "John Smith" --policy_user superuser --data_element text --enc
```
```
# decrypt
python samples/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "encrypted_data" --policy_user superuser --data_element text --dec
```
The `encrypted_data` value is obtained from the output of the encrypt command.

For more information about the `sample-app-protection.py`, run the following command:
```
python samples/sample-app-protection.py --help
```

##### Additional settings for using the Developer Edition API Service
  
Prior registration is required to obtain credentials for accessing the Developer Edition API Service. The following samples demonstrate how to protect and unprotect data using the Protection APIs. The Protection APIs rely on authenticated access to the Developer Edition API Service.

2.  Add the authentication information to the environment.
    1.  Open a command prompt.
    2.  Initialize a Python virtual environment.
        
    3.  Add the details to the environment using steps for your OS.
        - For Linux and MacOS:
            ```
            export DEV_EDITION_EMAIL='<Email_used_for_registration>'
            ```

            ```
            export DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD='<Password_provided_in_email>'
            ```

            ```
            export DEV_EDITION_API_KEY='<API_key_provided_in_email>'
            ```  

            Verify that the variables are set.
            ```
            test -n "$DEV_EDITION_EMAIL" && echo "EMAIL $DEV_EDITION_EMAIL set" || echo "EMAIL missing"
            test -n "$DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD" && echo "PASSWORD $DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD set" || echo "PASSWORD missing"
            test -n "$DEV_EDITION_API_KEY" && echo "API KEY $DEV_EDITION_API_KEY set" || echo "API KEY missing"
            ```
    
        - For Windows PowerShell:  
            ```
            $env:DEV_EDITION_EMAIL = '<Email_used_for_registration>' 
            ```

            ``` 
            $env:DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD = '<Password_provided_in_email>' 
            ```

            ``` 
            $env:DEV_EDITION_API_KEY = '<API_key_provided_in_email>'  
            ```  

            Verify that the variables are set
            ```
            if ($env:DEV_EDITION_EMAIL) { Write-Output "EMAIL $env:DEV_EDITION_EMAIL set"} else { Write-Output "EMAIL missing"} 
            if ($env:DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD) { Write-Output "PASSWORD $env:DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD set" } else { Write-Output "PASSWORD missing" } 
            if ($env:DEV_EDITION_API_KEY) { Write-Output "API KEY $env:DEV_EDITION_API_KEY set" } else { Write-Output "API KEY missing" } 
            ```

## 📄 Configuration

Edit `samples/config.json` to customize SDK behavior. 
Keys:
- `named_entity_map`: Optional mappings (friendly labels) used during redact/mask.
- `method`: `redact` (remove) or `mask` (replace with masking char).
- `masking_char`: Character for masking (when `method` = mask).
- `classification_score_threshold`: Minimum confidence (default 0.6 if omitted).
- `endpoint_url`: Override classification endpoint (defaults internally to docker compose service `http://localhost:8580/...`).
- `enable_logging`, `log_level`.

Current example:
```json
{
    "masking_char": "#",
    "named_entity_map": {
        "USERNAME": "USERNAME",
        "STATE": "STATE",
        "PHONE_NUMBER": "PHONE",
        "SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER": "SSN",
        "AGE": "AGE",
        "CITY": "CITY",
        "PERSON": "PERSON"
    },
    "method": "redact"
}
```

### Service Endpoints (default using docker compose)
- Classification API: `http://localhost:${CLASSIFICATION_PORT:-8580}/pty/data-discovery/v1.0/classify`
- Semantic Guardrail API: `http://localhost:${SGR_PORT:-8581}/pty/semantic-guardrail/v1.0/conversations/messages/scan`

If you change published ports in `docker-compose.yml`, update `endpoint_url`. Also, if required, update the semantic guardrail URL in the scripts.

### Docker Compose Services
`docker-compose.yml` provisions:
- `presidio-provider-service` and `roberta-provider-service`: ML provider backends.
- `classification-service`: Exposes Data Discovery REST API. Uses port 8580 by default.
- `semantic-guardrail-service`: Conversation risk and PII scanning depends on classification. Uses port 8581 by default.

Restart stack after changes to `docker-compose.yml` file from `protegrity-developer-edition` directory:
```
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

Check service logs for any errors from `protegrity-developer-edition` directory:
```
docker compose logs
```
