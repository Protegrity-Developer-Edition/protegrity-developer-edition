Hey AI,

I'm planning a surprise birthday party for my best friend next weekend and I need some help with the arrangements!

Here's what I'm thinking:
- Theme: 1980s retro arcade party
- Guest count: Around 25-30 people
- Venue: My backyard (weather permitting)
- Budget: Approximately $500

Can you help me with:
1. Menu suggestions for appetizers, main dishes, and desserts that fit the theme
2. Decoration ideas including color schemes, banners, and table settings
3. Music playlist recommendations with popular 80s hits
4. Fun party games and activities (both video games and non-digital games)
5. A timeline for party setup starting at 2 PM for a 4 PM start time
6. Ideas for a unique birthday cake design

Also, do you have any tips for keeping the party a secret? My friend is pretty observant and I'm worried they might figure it out!
